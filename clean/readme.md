Numerical Linear Algebra Final Project
======================================

Includes implementation of the following algorithms:
* GCR           (`gcr.m')
* ORTHODIR      (`orthodir.m')
* Simpler GMRES (`sgmres.m')
* RB-GMRES      (`rbgmres.m')

The files `backsub.m' and `givensRotation.m' provide functionality for basic linear algebra operations.  
The plots provided in the report are generated by `articlePlot.m', which depends on `articleMatrices.m' and `mmread.m' to load the matrices from the `Matrix Market' folder, which are downloaded from [Matrix Market](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/).
